# Rate Limiting with Upstash Redis and Hono

This project demonstrates how to implement rate limiting using Upstash Redis and the Hono web framework for Node.js. Rate limiting is a technique used to control the rate of incoming requests to an API or service, helping to prevent abuse, minimize server load, and ensure fair usage.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- An Upstash Redis instance (with the URL and token)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/rate-limiting-example.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd rate-limiting-example
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

Before running the application, you need to set the following environment variables with your Upstash Redis credentials:

- `UPSTASH_REDIS_URL`: The URL of your Upstash Redis instance.
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_TOKEN`: The token for your Upstash Redis instance.

You can set these variables in your system's environment or create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following contents:

```
UPSTASH_REDIS_URL=your-upstash-redis-url
UPSTASH_REDIS_TOKEN=your-upstash-redis-token
```

## Usage

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start listening on `http://localhost:8000`.

### Endpoints

- `GET /`: Returns a simple "Hello" message.
- `GET /mood`: Returns a welcome message for the mood log.
- `GET /mood/:id`: Returns a todo item with the specified ID. This endpoint is rate-limited to 2 requests per 30 seconds per IP address.

## Rate Limiting

The rate limiting implementation uses the `@upstash/ratelimit` package, which is backed by Upstash Redis. The rate limit is configured to allow 2 requests per 30 seconds per IP address for the `/mood/:id` endpoint.

If the rate limit is exceeded, the server will respond with a `429 Too Many Requests` status code and a JSON message indicating that the rate limit has been reached.

## Dependencies

- `hono`: A lightweight and modern Web Framework for Node.js.
- `@upstash/ratelimit`: A rate limiting library powered by Upstash Redis.
- `@upstash/redis`: A Redis client for Cloudflare Workers.
